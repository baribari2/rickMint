# Basic NFT(ERC721) Minting Site

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It is a site that allows users to mint NFTs on the click of a button. Didn't put too much time into styling, merely wanted to show implementation of ERC721 standards and functionclity with the 'mint' and 'connect' buttons.
